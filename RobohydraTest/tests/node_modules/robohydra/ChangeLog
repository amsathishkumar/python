Version 0.4 (2013-11-xx)
------------------------

	* Broken compatibility: the API of the "registerPluginObject"
	function has changed, check the new documentation. The function
	"requirePlugin" no longer exists.

	* Potential compatibility problem: the setHostHeader property of
	the proxy head is now true by default. It's unlikely that this
	change will bite anyone, but if you needed the proxy head to NOT
	set the Host HTTP header you have to change your
	RoboHydraHeadProxy definitions.

	* Potential compatibility problem: now dynamic heads have
	precedence over any dynamic heads created before. This behaviour
	makes much more sense (heads you create will override whatever the
	current behaviour is), and it's very unlikely that this change
	will be a problem for anyone, but if you're creating dynamic heads
	programmatically for some reason, check that this doesn't break
	your plugins.

	* Deprecated name "tests": now you should use "scenarios". It's
	just a name change, functionality stays the same. The functions
	"startTest" and "stoptest" are deprecated, and "startScenario" and
	"stopScenario" should be used instead (see next point for
	details).

	* External scenarios: scenarios can now be specified in separate
	files, in addition to inline inside the plugin's index.js
	file. Each scenario is a file inside the scenarios/ subdirectory
	of the plugin directory.

	* Scenario reliability: now scenarios should be more reliable, as
	heads contained in the scenario are reset to their original state
	(assuming they have any state at all; RoboHydraHeadStatic is
	currently the only head type with state, and only in the case of
	using multiple responses).

	* New "fixtures" module: plugins now have access to a second
	module, "fixtures". This module contains a single function,
	"load", that allows you to easily load files sitting in the
	fixtures/ subdirectory of the plugin directory.

	* Dynamic head priority: the registerDynamicHead method of the
	RoboHydra object now supports an optional parameter to specify the
	priority of the head (for now, only "normal" or "high"). Dynamic
	heads with "high" priority will be added to the
	"*priority-dynamic*" pseudo-plugin, which is placed before
	"*dynamic*". This is useful for plugins like "logger", which
	thanks to this change can add "overall" heads that will have
	precedence over regular dynamic heads added afterwards (see also
	the dynamic head precedence change above).

	* Multiple user support: RoboHydra servers can now be shared among
	several users. Each user will have her own state independent of
	the other users' state. This allows you to setup a single, shared
	RoboHydra server for a whole team, as opposed to every member of
	the team having to install RoboHydra in her own computer. See the
	"summoners" documentation for more information.

	* REST API: there is a new API to interact with the RoboHydra
	server. It's REST based, and for now it only supports JSON as a
	format. It allows you to check the loaded plugins, information
	about a given plugin, head or scenario, and change the state of a
	given head or scenario.

	* Admin UI: simplified the head and scenario list UI; static heads
	can now be created with a specific status code; show the hydra
	name (related to the multiple user support) and the date in which
	the server was started.

	* Logger plugin: it now logs the original request sent by the
	client, as opposed to the possibly-modified request (eg. the
	request could be modified in place before calling the next
	function).

	* Creating new head classes: there is now a function
	("roboHydraHeadType") to create head classes that inherit from
	other, existing head classes. See the documentation and examples
	for more details.

	* Command-line UI: now configuration files are optional, and
	plugins can be specified on the command-line directly (options
	-n and -P).

	* Add more and better examples to the examples/ folder.

	* Many code clean-ups and improvements.


Version 0.3 (2012-09-02)
------------------------

	* Potentially breaking change: assertion failures won't throw
	exceptions from now on. Instead, they will simply return
	false. This means that code after a failed assertion *does get
	executed* in RoboHydra 0.3. Most of the time this is exactly what
	you want. Moreover, it's much easier to simulate the old behaviour
	in RoboHydra 0.3, in the very few cases you might need it, than
	simulate the new behaviour with RoboHydra 0.2.

	* Streaming support: calls to the "write" method will be written
	immediately, even when chaining requests (when setup
	properly). This allows sending data in chunks, or sending data and
	never close the connection. Check the new "chain" and "on" methods
	in the Response class documentation for details.

	* Make heads more strict: heads will complain now about any
	properties they don't understand.

	* HTTPS: RoboHydra can now receive HTTPS requests, and
	RoboHydraProxyHead can connect to HTTPS websites.

	* Compact configuration: plugins with no special configuration can
	be specified in configuration files as a simple string (the plugin
	name), as opposed to a Javascript object with the keys "name" and
	"config".

	* New RoboHydraHeadFilter head: this new head allows you to filter
	the result of any matching request and return a different
	response. It understands compression and will transparently
	uncompress and compress back any compressed responses. See the
	documentation for more details.

	* New RoboHydraHeadWatchdog head: it allows you to watch the
	traffic for a certain pattern, and act when that pattern is
	found. For example, you might want to log responses containing a
	given text separately. It will transparently uncompress to make it
	easier to inspect response bodies.

	* Admin UI: now filesystem and proxy heads can be created
	dynamically from the web UI; URL paths for dynamically-created
	static content heads will now match GET parameters; the path
	debugger will now highlight *all* matching heads, not just the
	first one; the admin plugin is not shown on the list of heads
	anymore (see the source for details if you really want to show
	them).

	* RoboHydraFilesystemHead: add support for index files. See
	documentation for details.

	* RoboHydraFilesystemHead and RoboHydraProxyHead: "mountPath" is
	now treated as a plain string, meaning any special regexp
	characters must not be escaped from the mount path.

	* New request class: you can use it to create new, fake requests
	(eg. when chaining).

	* Query (GET) parameters: the "getParams" property is deprecated
	now, in favour of "queryParams".

	* Exceptions: if a head throws an exception, it will be caught and
	the request will return a 500 internal server error with the
	stacktrace as the response body.
